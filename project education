#The United States ranked in the top ten countries in the world in 2018 for most spent per pupil on K-12 education.
#This is largely because of the multi-level monetary process that goes into funding even the smallest of
# public schools. But, while the US is diverse, so are the amounts per state it actually spends on education.
# In this case, averages lie.

#The federal government provides about 7.7% of funding, state governments provide 46.7%, and local governments provide 45.6%. 
#This funding totals to the amount spent per pupil. This dataset looks at three different points– amount spent in total, 
#amount spent per pupil, and total amount spent on average on all students in a school in the state. My focus 
#is on the amount spent per pupil data. This map shows the amount spent per pupil in 2018 by state and is hoverable to show exact amounts.

#In 2018, the average spent was $13,139. The lowest amount was $7,576 while the high was
#$23,155. This graph shows how states changed from 1993 to 2018 where the majority of states who started out low, stayed low. 
#A majority of the states who were low were in the south, with the District of Columbia being an outlier with the most spent per pupil overall.
# Northeast states stayed significantly higher, always staying in the upper 50% of the chart. 


#Through these graphics, you can see that averages are but a number. 
#You can see how, while the average is technically high compared to the rest of the world, it is not close at all to reality. 
#The states are diverse in their spending. While this can be because of a variety of factors, the federal government can still step in whenever needed.  
#Red is a pacific state, orange is Northeast, blue is West, green is South and purple is Midwest.

#Side note to whoever is grading this– I tried to get international data for hours but alas,
#I could not find anything even partially clean enough to figure out! My plan was to have the second graph compare the mean,median and mode of US 
#spending to other countries (fun fact, Utah spends close to the same amount as Latvia) but it fell through. This would be way better if that happened! 
#I need more cleaning data practice it seems.
